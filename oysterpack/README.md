# OysterPack Rust Cloud Native Reactive Platform

The mission is to provide a platform to build cloud native [reactive](https://www.reactivemanifesto.org/) systems in Rust.

## Why Rust ?
Because I am confident that Rust is the future ...

[Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org) is simply the best systems programming language that we can **TRUST** for building production grade reactive systems.
Rust's focus on **safety**, **speed**, and **concurrency** delivers the performance and control of a low-level language, but with the powerful abstractions of a high-level language.
