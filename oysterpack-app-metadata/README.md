This crate defines the application metadata domain model.

It is meant to be used in conjunction with [oysterpack_built](https://crates.io/crates/oysterpack_built).
[oysterpack_built](https://crates.io/crates/oysterpack_built) generates the application build
metadata source file. This crate is used to load the application build netadata via the
[op_build_mod](macro.op_build_mod.html) macro.
