# OysterPack Rust Reactive Platform

The mission is to provide a platform to build [reactive](https://www.reactivemanifesto.org/)
systems in Rust.

## Why Rust ?
Because [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org) is the best systems programming language for building
production grade reactive systems today. It's main competitive advantages are:

1. Bare metal performance
2. Memory safety features guarantees with out the need for a garbage collector
    - garbage collectors add resource overhead and add to bloat
3. Small memory footprint
    - no language runtime required
    - no garbage collector
4. Rust compiler
    - prevents segfaults
    - prevents data races
    - smartest compiler in the market that detects runtime issues at compile time
    - compiler is designed to help you figure out what went wrong and provides suggestions
5. Cargo tooling and Rust ecosystem
    - simple to learn and use
    - promotes collaboration and productivity
    - [crates.io](https://crates.io/)
    - makes it easy to build and publish crates
