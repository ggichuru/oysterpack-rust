# OysterPack Rust Reactive Platform

The mission is to provide a platform to build [reactive](https://www.reactivemanifesto.org/) systems in Rust.

## Why Rust ?
Because [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org) is simply the best systems programming language for building production grade reactive systems that we can **tRust**.

Rust's focus on **safety**, **speed**, and **concurrency** delivers the performance and control of a low-level language,
but with the powerful abstractions of a high-level language. It's main competitive advantages are:

1. Bare metal performance
2. Memory safety features guarantees with out the need for a garbage collector
    - Rust enforces [RAII](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resource_acquisition_is_initialization), which shields against memory resource leak bugs
3. Small memory footprint
4. Rust compiler
    - smartest compiler in the market that detects runtime issues at compile time
    - compiler is designed to help you figure out what went wrong and provides suggestions
    - prevents segfaults
    - prevents data races
    - prevents memory leaks
    - ‘zero-cost abstractions’
5. Cargo tooling and Rust ecosystem
    - simple to learn and use
    - promotes collaboration and productivity
    - [crates.io](https://crates.io/)
    - makes it easy to build and publish crates
